1. Python (Programming Language)
Version: Python 3.x (ideally Python 3.7 or later)
Most libraries used in data analysis and visualization are compatible with Python 3.x.

2. Libraries and Tools
a. pandas
Purpose: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It helps in reading CSV files, cleaning data, and performing operations like filtering, grouping, and summarizing.
pip install pandas

b. matplotlib
Purpose: A popular plotting library used to create visualizations, such as bar graphs, line charts, and histograms.
pip install matplotlib

c. seaborn
Purpose: Built on top of matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
pip install seaborn

d. numpy
Purpose: Used for numerical operations. You may need it for any operations related to arrays or advanced math functions.
pip install numpy


3. Environment Setup
IDE/Editor: You can use any Python environment for coding. Here are some popular choices:
Google Colab: You’re already using Colab, which is excellent for notebooks and data analysis without installation.
Jupyter Notebook: Great for Python-based data analysis and visualization (you can run it locally or on cloud platforms).

4. Dataset
World Bank Data: You’ll need to download the population dataset (CSV file or Excel) from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. 

5. Git & GitHub 
Git:  version-control your code and data (or share it on GitHub).
GitHub Account: need an account on GitHub to upload and share your code.

6. System Requirements
Operating System: Should work on most operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
RAM: For small to medium datasets (such as population data), you’ll need at least 4GB of RAM, but 8GB or more is ideal for smoother performance.
Disk Space: Ensure you have enough space for storing data files, notebooks, and any related documents (a few GBs).
