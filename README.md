Data Science ProdigyTask-01 Sreenithi.R
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

#Population Data Analysis
-This project analyzes population data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators dataset. It focuses on analyzing population trends over the years (from 1960 to 2023) and visualizing key insights based
 on gender or other demographics, using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

#Key Features:
-Data Cleaning: Load raw population data, clean it, and handle missing or erroneous values.
-Visualization: Create visualizations such as bar graphs and line plots to showcase population trends for different countries and regions.
Gender Analysis: Analyze population data based on male and female populations for specific years (like 2020).

#Installation and Requirements
1. Install Python:
Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. You can download Python from here.

2. Install Required Libraries:
This project uses the following Python libraries:

pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib – for data visualization (plots, bar graphs)
seaborn – for enhanced statistical visualization
numpy – for numerical operations
openpyxl (optional) – for Excel file support

3. Download the Data:
Download the World Development Indicators dataset from the World Bank:

World Development Indicators - Population Data
 download it as a CSV or Excel file and place it in the project folder.

4. Running the Project:
Load the dataset and run the analysis by following the cells in the notebook.

#Example usage:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the population data
data = pd.read_csv('population_data.csv')

# Perform data cleaning and analysis here

# Create visualizations
data.plot(x='Country Name', y='2020')
plt.show()
